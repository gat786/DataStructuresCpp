# Binary Tree

Binary tree implementation includes operations such as 

1. Basic Operations
    * Inserting an element into a tree
    * Deleting an element from a tree
    * Searching for an element
    * Traversing the tree

2. Auxiliary Operations
    * Finding the size of the tree
    * Finding the height of the tree 
    * Finding the level which has maximum sum
    * Finding the least common ancestor (LCA) for a given pair of nodes, 
    and many more.

Applications of Binary Trees

Following are the some of the applications where binary trees play an important 
role:
* Expression trees are used in compilers.
* Huffman coding trees that are used in data compression algorithms.
* Binary Search Tree (BST), which supports search, insertion and deletion on 
a collection of items in O(logn) (average).
* Priority Queue (PQ), which supports search and deletion of minimum (or 
maximum) on a collection of items in logarithmic time (in worst case).
