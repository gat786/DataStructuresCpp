# Data Structures implemented in CPlusPlus 

I am trying to implement all the basic Data Structures that are required for 
any software engineering job. while it may not be necessary for every software
engineering job out there but it will surely help you out a lot in writing 
logical and more production quality code.

The links for every implemented Data Structure is defined as below

1. [Singly Linked Lists](./SinglyLinkedList)  
2. [Doubly Linked Lists](./DoublyLinkedList)
