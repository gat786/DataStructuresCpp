# Data Structures implemented in CPlusPlus 

I am trying to implement all the basic Data Structures that are required for 
any software engineering job. while it may not be necessary for every software
engineering job out there but it will surely help you out a lot in writing 
logical and more production quality code.

if you find any bugs in the written code or simply you want to contribute feel 
free to leave a PR. I will surely check and add it if fits right ;-)

The links for every implemented Data Structure is defined as below

#### [LinkedLists](LinkedList/)

#### Stacks -
