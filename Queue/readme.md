# Queue 

The following operations make a queue an ADT. 
Insertions and deletions in the queue must follow the FIFO scheme. 

For simplicity we assume the elements are integers.
* Main Queue Operations 
  1. EnQueue(int data): Inserts an element at the end of the queue
  2. int DeQueue(): Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue


* Auxiliary Queue Operations 
  1. int Front(): Returns the element at the front without removing it
  2. int QueueSize(): Returns the number of elements stored in the queue
  3. int IsEmptyQueueQ: Indicates whether no elements are stored in the queue or not

There are several ways in which a queue can be implemented and they are implemented 
in the following folders.
